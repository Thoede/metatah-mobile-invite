## Local Development (Running the Website on Your Computer)

To run the website locally on your computer, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Thoede/metatah-mobile-invite.git

```
Alternatively, you can download the ZIP file of the project and extract it to your preferred directory.
2. Open the Project Folder

Navigate to the folder where the project files are located.
3. Open the HTML File

Open the index.html file in your web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari). This will display the website locally.
4. Testing the Site Locally

    Ensure that all assets such as images, stylesheets (styles.css), and JavaScript (script.js) are in the correct file paths.
    If your website includes features that depend on external services (like APIs), ensure that the required APIs are properly connected.

Special Notes

    The website is optimized for mobile screens with resolutions between 320px and 768px.
    Ensure your browser's developer tools are set to mobile mode to view the site as it would appear on a mobile device.
