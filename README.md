    - Alternatively, download the ZIP file of the project and extract it to your preferred directory.
  2. Open the Project Folder: Navigate to the folder where the project files are located.
  3. Open the HTML File: Open the index.html file in your web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari). This will display the website locally.
  4. Testing the Site Locally:
    - Ensure that all assets such as images, stylesheets (styles.css), and JavaScript (script.js) are in the correct file paths.
    - If your website includes features that depend on external services (like APIs), ensure that the required APIs are properly connected.
